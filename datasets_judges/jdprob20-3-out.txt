JUDGE NOTE: This is unlike any student data, unique to judges.
My (Ken's) program prints the same result twice, due to looping on the
two empty positions in the first line.  They're only expected to find the
solution - it doesn't matter if they print it twice.  It does matter if
they print the wrong one.
